- âœ… API calls route to AWS Lambda endpoint: `https://h5ztvjxo03.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/signup/teacher`
- âœ… Successful HTTP 201 response with user data and JWT token
- âœ… No CORS errors in browser console
- âœ… User authentication and token storage working
- âœ… All 16 tests passing (including React component tests with jsdom)

**Browser Console Logs**:
```
[log] Sending teacher signup request to: https://h5ztvjxo03.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/signup/teacher
[log] Signup successful: {message: Teacher account created successfully, user: Object, token: eyJ...}
[log] Login successful, user role: TEACHER
```

### ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

**Frontend Changes**:
- Added `signupTeacher()` function in `src/services/api.ts` for AWS Lambda integration

- Proper error handling and response parsing
- JWT token generation and storage
- User data persistence in Aurora PostgreSQL

### ðŸš€ Deployment Status

**CI/CD Pipeline**: âœ… All checks passing (1 pass, 0 fail)
**AWS Lambda**: âœ… Deployed and functional
**Aurora Database**: âœ… Connected and operational
**Frontend**: âœ… Ready for production deployment

### ðŸ”— Key URLs

- **AWS API Gateway**: `https://h5ztvjxo03.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev`

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Production

1. **Azure Static Web App Configuration**:
   - Set `VITE_AWS_API_URL=https://h5ztvjxo03.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev` in Azure portal
   - Deploy updated frontend code to Azure Static Web App
   - Remove any existing `/api/*` proxy rules in Azure configuration

2. **Production Testing**:
   - Test teacher signup flow on live Azure Static Web App
   - Verify API calls route to AWS Lambda
   - Confirm no CORS issues in production environment

The integration is complete and ready for production deployment.
