# Performance Diagnosis for BrightBoost Home Page

## Current Performance Issues

The BrightBoost home page (https://brave-bay-0bfacc110-production.centralus.6.azurestaticapps.net) is experiencing slow initial load times. After analyzing the application code and build output, the following performance bottlenecks have been identified:

### Primary Bottleneck: Large JavaScript Bundle Size

The main JavaScript bundle is 350.02 KB uncompressed (111.00 KB gzipped, 93.58 KB with Brotli compression). This large bundle size is the primary cause of the slow initial page load, as all JavaScript must be downloaded, parsed, and executed before the page becomes interactive.

Key contributors to the bundle size:

- **No Code Splitting**: All routes and components are bundled together, even though most aren't needed for the initial home page render
- **Unused UI Components**: Many Radix UI components are imported in the bundle but not used on the home page
- **Icon Library**: The lucide-react icon library is imported without tree-shaking
- **Tailwind Utilities**: tailwind-merge adds significant size to the bundle

### Secondary Issues

- **CSS Bundle Size**: 62.70 KB uncompressed (11.11 KB gzipped, 9.26 KB with Brotli)
- **No Lazy Loading**: All page components are eagerly loaded regardless of the current route
- **Font Loading**: Custom fonts (Montserrat) may be blocking rendering

## Recommended Solution

The most effective solution to improve home page performance is to implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense for route-based components. This will significantly reduce the initial JavaScript bundle size by only loading the code needed for the current route.

Additional optimizations include:

1. Tree-shaking for icon imports
2. Optimizing Tailwind configuration
3. Preloading critical assets
4. Implementing font display swap
