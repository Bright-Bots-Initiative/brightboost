# Contributing to Bright Bots Front-End

Thank you for helping us build joyful K-8 STEM tools! This guide shows you how to run, test, and submit code to the frontend repo.

## Quick-start Prerequisites

- Node 18 LTS (`nvm install 18`)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- VS Code + ESLint/Prettier extensions (recommended)

## Local Dev Commands

- `npm install` â€“ install dependencies
- `npm run dev` â€“ start Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173`)
- `npm run lint` â€“ check code for style and potential issues
- `npm run test` â€“ run tests
- `npm run test:watch` â€“ run tests in watch mode
- `npm run storybook` â€“ start Storybook for component development (`http://localhost:6006`)

## Branch-Naming Rules

| Purpose    | Pattern            | Example                      |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Feature    | feat/<area>/<slug> | feat/student/lesson-progress |
| Bug-fix    | fix/<area>/<slug>  | fix/auth/login-validation    |
| Chore/docs | chore/<slug>       | chore/update-readme          |

**Tip:** One issue â†” one branch â†” one PR

## Commit Message Style

We follow the Conventional Commits standard. Format: `<type>(<scope>): <short summary>`

Examples:

- `feat(student): add lesson progress tracking`
- `fix(api): correct authentication header handling`
- `chore: update dependencies`

## Pre-Commit Hooks

We recommend setting up Husky to run linting and tests before commits:

- `npm run lint` checks code style and potential issues
- `npm run test --silent` ensures all tests pass

## Pull-Request Checklist

- [ ] PR title follows Conventional Commits format
- [ ] Code passes linting (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Storybook components updated if UI changed
- [ ] Screenshots/Loom video for UI changes
- [ ] Issue linked and labeled appropriately
- [ ] Reviewers tagged (always include @Louis-Albanez + one peer)

## Automated PR Review Bot ðŸ¤–

To help maintain code quality and provide quick feedback, we have an automated PR Review Bot that checks your pull requests. When you open or update a PR, the bot will automatically perform the following checks:

- **Coding Style & Linting:** Ensures code adheres to the project's ESLint rules (as run by `npm run lint`).
- **Test Execution:** Verifies that all tests pass (`npm run test`).
- **Documentation:** Checks for JSDoc-style comments on new or significantly changed exported functions and classes in `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- **Basic Security Scan:** Looks for common potential security issues, such as the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React components.

The bot will post its findings as a comment directly on your pull request. Please review this feedback and address any reported issues before tagging human reviewers. This helps streamline the review process and ensures your contributions meet our quality standards.

## Coding Standards

- ESLint config based on TypeScript and React 18 best practices
- Functional components and hooks only (no class components)
- Folder naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components (e.g., `Button`, `UserCard`)
  - camelCase for hooks, utilities, etc. (e.g., `useAuth`, `formatDate`)
