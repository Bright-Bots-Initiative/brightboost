# Azure Function App 503 Error Diagnosis - RUNTIME STACK MISMATCH

## Root Cause Identified
- **Critical Issue**: Azure Function App `bb-dev-func` configured with **Python runtime stack** but contains **JavaScript/Node.js code**
- **Evidence**: All endpoints return "Function host is not running" despite successful CI deployment
- **Azure Limitation**: Runtime stack cannot be changed after Function App creation

## Previous Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **Workflow Configuration**: Added `api_location: "api"` to enable Azure Functions deployment
2. ✅ **CI Deployment**: Build and Deploy Job passing successfully
3. ✅ **Network Connectivity**: HTTPS connection to Function App working
4. ❌ **Runtime Mismatch**: Python runtime cannot execute JavaScript functions

## Required Solution: Migration to New Function App
Since Azure does not allow changing runtime stack after creation, must create new Function App:

### Migration Steps Required
1. **Create new Function App** with Node.js runtime stack (18 LTS)
2. **Configure environment variables** in new app:
   ```
   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
3. **Update CI/CD configuration** to deploy to new Node.js Function App
4. **Test all endpoints** to verify functionality
5. **Archive old Python Function App** after successful migration

## Current Status
- ❌ All `/api/*` endpoints return 503 "Function host is not running"
- ❌ Function App runtime fails to start (Python cannot execute JavaScript)
- ✅ CI deployment pipeline working correctly
- ✅ JavaScript function code is properly structured

## Next Steps
1. Create new Azure Function App with Node.js runtime
2. Follow migration plan in `AZURE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
3. Update deployment configuration
4. Test and validate all endpoints
